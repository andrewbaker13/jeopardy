STATISTICAL CONCEPTS,200,"In hypothesis testing, this is the threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis, commonly set at 0.05.","What is the Significance Level (or Alpha)?",text,,No
STATISTICAL CONCEPTS,400,"This value indicates the probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true.","What is the p-value?",text,,No
STATISTICAL CONCEPTS,600,"A range of values derived from sample statistics that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter.","What is a Confidence Interval?",text,,No
STATISTICAL CONCEPTS,800,"This type of error occurs when you fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false (a 'false negative').","What is a Type II Error?",text,,No
STATISTICAL CONCEPTS,1000,"This refers to the probability that a statistical test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis.","What is Statistical Power?",text,,No
CORRELATION & CAUSATION,200,"A numerical measure that expresses the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to +1.","What is a Correlation Coefficient (r)?",text,,No
CORRELATION & CAUSATION,400,"The famous phrase reminding us that a relationship between two variables does not mean one causes the other.","What is 'Correlation does not imply causation'?",text,,No
CORRELATION & CAUSATION,600,"A variable that is statistically related to both the independent and dependent variables, creating a misleading association.","What is a Confounding Variable?",text,,No
CORRELATION & CAUSATION,800,"A relationship between two variables that appears to be causal but is actually due to a third, unmeasured variable.","What is a Spurious Correlation?",text,,Yes
CORRELATION & CAUSATION,1000,"To establish this, one must demonstrate temporal precedence, covariation, and the absence of alternative explanations.","What is Causation (or Causality)?",text,,No
REGRESSION ANALYSIS,200,"In a regression model, this is the variable that you are trying to predict.","What is the Dependent Variable?",text,,No
REGRESSION ANALYSIS,400,"This statistic, ranging from 0 to 1, represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).","What is R-squared?",text,,No
REGRESSION ANALYSIS,600,"A regression model with one independent variable is called this.","What is Simple Linear Regression?",text,,No
REGRESSION ANALYSIS,800,"In a regression equation, this term represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable.","What is the Coefficient (or Slope)?",text,,No
REGRESSION ANALYSIS,1000,"A type of regression used when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, win/loss).","What is Logistic Regression?",text,,No
DATA VISUALIZATION,200,"A circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.","What is a Pie Chart?",text,,No
DATA VISUALIZATION,400,"A graph that uses rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent, often used for comparing categories.","What is a Bar Chart?",text,,No
DATA VISUALIZATION,600,"A type of chart used to display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments, often used to show trends over time.","What is a Line Chart?",text,,No
DATA VISUALIZATION,800,"A graph that shows the relationship between two quantitative variables, with individual data points plotted on a two-dimensional plane.","What is a Scatter Plot?",text,,No
DATA VISUALIZATION,1000,"A graphical representation of data that uses a system of 'whiskers' to display the distribution and variability of a dataset.","What is a Box Plot (or Box-and-Whisker Plot)?",text,,No
REPORTING INSIGHTS,200,"A brief, high-level summary of the key findings and recommendations of a research report, placed at the beginning.","What is an Executive Summary?",text,,No
