# --- INSTRUCTIONS START BELOW THIS LINE ---
# IMPORTANT: Lines starting with a '#' are ignored by the game and should be used for instructions only.
# 
# CUSTOM GAME TITLE & JUDGE MODE (OPTIONAL):
# - To set a custom title make the first row: GameTitle Your Custom Game Title
# - To enable Judge Mode (an answer key view) add a second row: JudgeCode 123456 (use any 6-digit code)
# 
# ROUND STRUCTURE & LAYOUT:
# - The 'Round' column sets which round a clue belongs to (1 or 2). A game can have just Round 1, just Round 2, or both.
# - The app supports flexible board layouts!
#   - A round can have between 1 and 5 categories.
#   - Each category in a round must have the same number of clues (between 2 and 5).
# - The classic 5x5 layout is recommended, but custom sizes (e.g., 4 categories x 3 clues) will work. A confirmation will appear for non-standard layouts.
# - Category names MUST be identical for all clues within that category for a given round.
# 
# FINAL JEOPARDY (OPTIONAL):
# - To add a Final Jeopardy round create one row where the 'Category' is 'FINAL JEOPARDY' and the 'Round' is 'FJ'.
# - The 'Value' column for this row should contain the Final Jeopardy category name (e.g., HISTORIC DOCUMENTS).
# 
# DAILY DOUBLES:
# - Set the 'DailyDouble' column to 'Yes' to make a clue a Daily Double. Leave blank or 'No' for normal clues.
# 
# MEDIA TYPES & RICH CONTENT:
# - 'MediaType' can be 'text' (default) 'image' 'video' 'html' or 'mc' (multiple choice).
# - 'MediaURL' is used for 'image' 'video' and 'html' types.
# 
# - IMAGES (MediaType: image):
#   - Use a publicly accessible DIRECT URL that ends in .jpg, .png, etc. Standard Google Drive/Dropbox *sharing* links will NOT work.
# 
# - VIDEOS (MediaType: video):
#   - You MUST use the **EMBED URL** (the URL found inside the iframe tag when sharing/embedding a video).
#   - YouTube Example https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID_HERE
#   - Vimeo Example https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEO_ID_HERE
# 
# - HTML (MediaType: html):
#   - Paste rich HTML content directly into the 'MediaURL' cell. The app safely renders tags like <b> <i> <ul> <table> <img> and <a>.
# 
# - MULTIPLE CHOICE (MediaType: mc):
#   - Provide 2 to 5 answer options in the 'MC_Answers' column separated by semicolons (e.g. Choice A;Choice B;Choice C).
#   - The 'Answer' column must still contain the text of the correct response.
# 
# OTHER COLUMNS & TIPS:
# - The 'Explanation' column is optional. Add any extra teaching notes you want to show after the correct response is revealed.
# - When using a TSV file, you don't need to worry about quoting cells that contain commas.
