Custom CSV Jeopardy Upload

## Features
- Load CSV/TSV or Google Sheets (any column order) with custom formatting, media, and judge mode support.
- Supports flexible boards: 1‑5 categories per round, 2‑5 clues per category, and full diagnostics (rows, layout warnings, non‑standard board confirmation).
- Auto timer control appears only when enabled, theme selection persists, and the save/load flows capture the full state (team names, scores, timer, judge mode, layout).
- Detailed guidance in setup for publishing Google Sheets (per-tab, TSV export) and immediate highlighted validation feedback for category/clue issues.
