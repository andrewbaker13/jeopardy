# --- INSTRUCTIONS START BELOW THIS LINE ---
# IMPORTANT: Lines starting with a '#' are ignored by the game and should be used for instructions only.
#
# CUSTOM GAME TITLE:
"# The very first row should start with ""GameTitle"" in the first column",and your desired game title in the second column.
"# Example: GameTitle ""My Awesome History Game"""
#
# ROUND STRUCTURE:
# - The 'Round' column determines which round a clue belongs to (1 or 2).
# - A valid game can have just Round 1,just Round 2,or both.
# - A complete Round 1 MUST have 5 categories with values 100,200,300,400,500 for each (25 clues total).
# - A complete Round 2 MUST have 5 categories with values 200,400,600,800,1000 for each (25 clues total).
# - Category names MUST be identical for all 5 clues within that category for a given round.
# - If both rounds are present,the game will automatically switch to Round 2 after all Round 1 clues are played.
#
# FINAL JEOPARDY:
# - To add a Final Jeopardy round,create one row where the 'Category' is 'FINAL JEOPARDY' and the 'Round' is 'FJ'.
#
# OTHER COLUMNS:
"# - To include commas in Clue or Answer text you MUST enclose the entire cell content in double quotes (e.g. ""This answer is in fact correct"")."
"# - The Answer column is pre-filled with ""What is the answer?"" as a placeholder—replace it with your own text."
# - The 'Explanation' column is optional. Add any extra teaching notes you want to show after the correct response (HTML is allowed,just like in Clue text).
#
# DAILY DOUBLES:
# The 'DailyDouble' column determines if a clue is a Daily Double.
# - Set the value to 'Yes' to make it a Daily Double.
# - Set the value to 'No' (or leave it blank) for a normal clue.
# MEDIA INSTRUCTIONS:
# MediaType can be 'text' (default),'image','video','html',or 'mc' (multiple choice).
# MediaURL is only required for 'image' or 'video' clues. MC clues ignore MediaURL but require entries in MC_Answers.
#
# MULTIPLE CHOICE (MediaType: mc):
# Provide 2-5 answer options in the MC_Answers column,separated by semicolons (e.g.,Choice A;Choice B;Choice C). The Answer column still stores the correct response text.
#
# IMAGES (MediaType: image):
# Use a publicly accessible DIRECT URL that ends in an image extension (.jpg .png etc.).
# Standard Google Drive or Dropbox *sharing* links will usually NOT work.
#
# VIDEOS (MediaType: video):
# You MUST use the **EMBED URL** (the URL found inside the iframe tag when sharing/embedding a video).
# - YouTube Example: Use https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID_HERE.
# - Vimeo Example: Use https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEO_ID_HERE.
