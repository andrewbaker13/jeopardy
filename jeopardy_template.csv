# --- INSTRUCTIONS START BELOW THIS LINE ---
# IMPORTANT: Lines starting with a '#' are ignored by the game and should be used for instructions only.
#
# CUSTOM GAME TITLE:
# The very first row should start with "GameTitle" in the first column, and your desired game title in the second column.
# Example: GameTitle "My Awesome History Game"
#
# ROUND STRUCTURE:
# - The 'Round' column determines which round a clue belongs to (1 or 2).
# - A valid game can have just Round 1, just Round 2, or both.
# - A complete Round 1 MUST have 5 categories with values 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 for each (25 clues total).
# - A complete Round 2 MUST have 5 categories with values 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 for each (25 clues total).
# - Category names MUST be identical for all 5 clues within that category for a given round.
# - If both rounds are present, the game will automatically switch to Round 2 after all Round 1 clues are played.
#
# FINAL JEOPARDY:
# - To add a Final Jeopardy round, create one row where the 'Category' is 'FINAL JEOPARDY' and the 'Round' is 'FJ'.
#
# OTHER COLUMNS:
# - To include commas in Clue or Answer text you MUST enclose the entire cell content in double quotes (e.g. "This answer is in fact correct").
#
# DAILY DOUBLES:
# The 'DailyDouble' column determines if a clue is a Daily Double.
# - Set the value to 'Yes' to make it a Daily Double.
# - Set the value to 'No' (or leave it blank) for a normal clue.
# MEDIA INSTRUCTIONS:
# MediaType can be 'text' (default) 'image' 'video' or 'html'.
# MediaURL is only required for 'image' or 'video' clues.
#
# IMAGES (MediaType: image):
# Use a publicly accessible DIRECT URL that ends in an image extension (.jpg .png etc.). 
# Standard Google Drive or Dropbox *sharing* links will usually NOT work.
#
# VIDEOS (MediaType: video):
# You MUST use the **EMBED URL** (the URL found inside the iframe tag when sharing/embedding a video).
# - YouTube Example: Use https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID_HERE.
